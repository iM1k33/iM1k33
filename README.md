Learning Python coding and AI technology
----------------------------------------

From the youngest age I was obsessed with computers and electronics. Mostly I was interested in games but tried myself in Delphi coding at school. I studied "Applied Informatics in Economics" at the university, then obtained a second higher degree in "Networks and Telecommunications," but unfortunately, I had little real experience in these fields except 6 years of working as Windows Server Domain networks administrator in some companies. For almost 12 years, I worked in areas unrelated to IT, but always wanted to learn programming and solve real practical problems. And now, finally, I'm here, taking a course on programming in Python and AI technology.

* 🌍  I'm based in Russia, mostly in south regions.
